## 0. Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process that allows designers to visualize the structure and functionality of a website or application before any actual design or coding takes place. It serves as a blueprint, helping to outline the layout, content placement, and navigation flow, ensuring that the user interface (UI) is both intuitive and user-friendly. The importance of wireframing lies in its ability to create a visual representation of ideas, helping teams align their understanding early on and avoid costly mistakes in the later stages of development.
